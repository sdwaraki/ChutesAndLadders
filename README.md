# Chutes and Ladders

Chutes and Ladders (Also Snake and Ladders in some places) is a board game that is usually played by 4 players who use a 
cubical dice/spinner. The board is made of 10x10 grid with values on each cell from 1-100.
Some cells are special. 

A cell can be one of the three types:
 
 - Chute : When a player ends up on this cell, he is to be taken to a cell of a lower value.
 - Ladder : When a player ends up on this cell, he is to be taken to a cell of higher value.
 - Normal Cell: Nothing happens when a player ends up on this cell.
  
Each player is assigned a pawn and uses the dice/spinner on his turn to get a number between 1 and 6 to move in the board from the current position. 
The first player to reach the cell number 100 is considered to be the winner.
